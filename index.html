      <p>This is my Mejala Family. They are one of the reasons why I'm still here. 
        They are the ones who I grew up with. I love these people and I know they 
        love me as well, and I thank God for giving me this family. <br><br> From

      <h2>My Family History</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our family, we have a total of 9 members. My grandfather's name is Numeriano
         Mejala, and his wife, Sittirabia Lahuran Mejala, are my mother's parents. As you
          can see, my grandmothers name is a bit different, its because she's a native
           from Mindanao. They have 3 children named, Marlon, Matrimar, and Mark. My uncle 
           Marlon doesn't have a family of his own and he's currently at Metro Manila. My 
          mom, Matrimar aka Mhatty, is at Tarlac with her husband, Ace, and my sister Samantha.
          While they stay at Tarlac City, I and Kiana currently stays with our grandparents. My
           other uncle, Mark, have a daughter named Hyacinth, which is also here with us.
